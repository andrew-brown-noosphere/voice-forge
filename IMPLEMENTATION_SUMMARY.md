# VoiceForge Implementation Summary

I've implemented VoiceForge, a website crawling and content processing system with the following components:

## Backend (Python/FastAPI)

### Core Components
1. **Crawler Module**: Robust web crawler using Playwright for JavaScript rendering with configurable parameters for depth, rate limiting, and content discovery.
2. **Processor Module**: Content extraction engine that intelligently extracts meaningful content from web pages, detects content types, and extracts metadata.
3. **Database Module**: PostgreSQL integration with pgvector extension for vector search capabilities.
4. **API Module**: RESTful API endpoints for crawl management and content search.

### Features
- Respects robots.txt and implements proper rate limiting
- Extracts content with intelligent recognition of main content areas
- Categorizes content types (blog posts, articles, product descriptions, etc.)
- Vector-based content similarity search
- Detailed metadata extraction (authors, dates, categories, tags)

## Frontend (React/Material UI)

### Pages
1. **Dashboard**: Overview of crawl statistics and recent crawls
2. **New Crawl**: Multi-step form for configuring and starting crawls
3. **Crawl Details**: Real-time monitoring of crawl progress and extracted content
4. **Content Search**: Advanced search interface with filtering capabilities
5. **Content Details**: Content viewer with metadata display and original HTML view
6. **Settings**: System configuration management

### Features
- Responsive Material UI design
- Real-time updates for active crawls
- Interactive content search and browsing
- Visualization of crawl statistics

## Deployment
- Docker containerization for both frontend and backend components
- Docker Compose configuration for simple deployment
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for similarity search

The implementation follows all the requirements specified in the original document, with the name changed from BrandEcho to VoiceForge as requested.

The system is designed to be easily extensible for future phases, such as integration with language models for content generation.
