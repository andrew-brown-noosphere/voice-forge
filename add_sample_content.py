                RAG is particularly useful for creating content that needs to be factual and grounded in specific knowledge.
                By retrieving relevant documents or chunks of text, the system can produce more accurate and contextually appropriate content.
                
                The process typically involves three steps: retrieving relevant information, ranking the results by relevance,
                and then generating content that incorporates the most useful retrieved information. This approach helps ensure
