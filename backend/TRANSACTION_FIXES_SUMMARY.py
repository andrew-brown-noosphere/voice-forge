Summary of fixes applied to resolve InFailedSqlTransaction errors in VoiceForge backend.

print("🔧 VoiceForge Transaction Error Fixes Applied")
print("=" * 50)
print()

print("📋 ISSUES IDENTIFIED:")
print("   • InFailedSqlTransaction errors occurring when PostgreSQL transactions fail")
print("   • Singleton service pattern causing shared database sessions between requests")
print("   • Insufficient error handling and transaction rollback logic")
print("   • Session state not properly managed after failed transactions")
print()

print("✅ FIXES APPLIED:")
print()

print("1. DEPENDENCIES.PY - Session Management:")
print("   • Removed singleton pattern for services (no more shared sessions)")
print("   • Each API request now gets a fresh database session")
print("   • Enhanced error handling with proper rollback and logging")
print("   • Session cleanup in finally block to prevent connection leaks")
print()

print("2. DATABASE/DB.PY - Transaction Safety:")
print("   • Added _safe_execute() wrapper for all database operations")
print("   • Enhanced _ensure_session_health() method for better recovery")
print("   • Proper SQLAlchemy error handling with specific exception types")
print("   • Automatic transaction rollback on any database error")
print("   • All methods now use the safe execution pattern")
print()

print("🚀 BENEFITS:")
print("   • No more InFailedSqlTransaction errors")
print("   • Better isolation between API requests")
print("   • Improved error logging and debugging")
print("   • Automatic recovery from failed transactions")
print("   • Cleaner session lifecycle management")
print()

print("📝 FILES MODIFIED:")
print("   • api/dependencies.py (backed up as dependencies.py.bak)")
print("   • database/db.py (original saved as db_original.py)")
print()

print("🔄 NEXT STEPS:")
print("   1. Restart your backend server")
print("   2. Test your API endpoints")
print("   3. Monitor logs - you should see better error handling")
print("   4. The '[parameters: ...]' errors should be resolved")
print()

print("💡 TECHNICAL DETAILS:")
print("   • Each request now gets: get_db_session() -> Database(session)")
print("   • No more shared state between requests")
print("   • Failed transactions are automatically rolled back")
print("   • Sessions are always closed after use")
print("   • SQLAlchemy errors are caught and handled gracefully")
print()

print("🎯 The core issue was that when a SQL transaction failed, the session")
print("   remained in an 'aborted' state, and subsequent queries would fail with")
print("   'InFailedSqlTransaction' until a ROLLBACK was issued. The fixes ensure")
print("   proper transaction management and session isolation.")
